This is a Personal Website project that is based off of an
earlier website that I created.  The is to practice
using all of the HTML and CSS that Ive learned so far in the 
course that im taking at Full Stack Academy.  Additionally, I
will be practicing using "Git" and staying up to date with
my project by pushing things to my repository on GitHub. 

The layout of the website is just a simple project that has
information about me, a portfolio showing some of my work, and
a contact page  so that somebody could get ahold of me if needed.
